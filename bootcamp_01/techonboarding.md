### Things to know about Git

Basic Configuration (needed before commit):

git config --global credential.helper store
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
```

To update from Command Prompt `git update-git-for-windows`

## Docker

### Useful commands to know

These are useful if you JupyterLab instance has locked up

* `docker ps` list running containers
* `docker kill $(docker ps -q)` stop any running containers
* `docker rm $(docker ps -aq)` remove any stopped containers
* `docker logs wfbmi-dev` If you need to get the url\token to log back into your instance

## Jupyter

See [Notebook](JupyterIntro.ipynb)

### To Spin up Jupter Lab locally

```shell
docker run -p 8888:8888 -v C:/home:/home/jovyan/work --user root -e JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB=yes -e GRANT_SUDO=yes --name wfbmi-dev ghcr.io/wake-forest-ctsi/wfbmi-dev:latest
```
*Note:* I've recently updated the image source from `jupyter/datascience-notebook:latest` to bake in some customizations.  Please use the updated version above if you have any certificate issues.

### If you lose/forget your token

- Start up the wfbmi-dev container in docker desktop
- click on logs and look for the login url
- if you can't find it there, open up command prompt and run the following:
  ```shell
    docker exec wfbmi-dev jupyter server list
  ```
*Note:* The url in this output will give you security errors.  Please use `http://localhost:8888/?token=` instead.

## CITI Training

Before being able to access PHI, you must complete â€‹[CITI training](https://about.citiprogram.org/en/homepage/) (and do so every three years). The relevant course is called Biomedical Investigators (Human Research > Biomedical Investigators > Basic Course).

The first time you do this it will likely take you a couple of hours. Make sure you associate your account/certification with Wake Forest School of Medicine (ID: 438)
